🛡️ Cryptography Learning App 🔐

"Making encryption easy to understand—one visual at a time!"

📌 Overview
The Cryptography Learning App is an interactive web platform designed to visually demonstrate encryption techniques such as AES, RSA, SHA-256, and HMAC. 🚀(Currently I'm working on only these four)

Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this app will help you understand how cryptographic algorithms work through step-by-step visualizations.

✨ Features
✅ Interactive Encryption & Decryption: Simulate AES, RSA, Hashing, and HMAC processes.

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown: Watch encryption happen in real-time with animations.

✅ Sender-Receiver Simulation: See how secure communication works in cryptography.

✅ User-Friendly UI: A clean & modern interface for easy learning.

✅ Lightweight & Fast: Built with React.js + Vite, optimized for performance.
